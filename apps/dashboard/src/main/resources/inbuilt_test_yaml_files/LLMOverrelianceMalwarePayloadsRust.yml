  description: >
    "LLMs can generate inaccurate or inappropriate content, hallucinate, or produce incoherent responses. 
    Inaccurate results can mislead the target users and trigger a vulnerability"

    "Evaluating the data integrity checks implemented for the LLM.
    Output checks to prevent LLM sending wrong data to the end user"
  impact: >
    "The impacts of a misleading LLM output or response can vary greatly - affecting 
    the data to influencing critical decision making
    processes under the guise of normal operation"
