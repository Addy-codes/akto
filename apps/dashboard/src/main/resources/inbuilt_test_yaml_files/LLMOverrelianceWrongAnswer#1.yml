  description: >
    "LLMs can generate inaccurate or inappropriate content, hallucinate, or produce incoherent responses. Inaccurate results can mislead the target users and trigger a vulnerability"

    "Evaluating the data integrity checks implemented for the LLM. Output checks to prevent LLM sending wrong data to the end user"
  impact: >
    "The impacts of a misleading LLM output or response can vary greatly - affecting the data to influencing critical decision making processes under the guise of normal operation"
